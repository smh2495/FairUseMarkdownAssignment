###**Bob Marley "Is This Love" Remix: Fair?**
By Sydney Harper


The blog entry that I posted in class was a remix to a beloved Bob Marley song that was released on the 1978 album, _Kaya_.

The remix to the song was made by Vicetone and can be found on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/thebestedm2015/vicetone-x-bob-marley-is-this-love-free-download), a **"social sound sharing"** site that allows people to create and distribute the things they make to people around the world. 

#BUT--

If we look back at our discussions in class about what constitutes Fair Use, we see that there is a pretty easy-to-understand list that outlines criteria for creators to follow:

	Factors Contributing to Fair Use  
	
	1.Purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes
	2. Nature of the copyrighted work
	3. Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole
	4. Effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work

So, the question is:  were any rules broken by these artists who just wanted to pay tribute to one of the greatest musicians to grace this Earth? 
 
####Breaking the Rules
Unfortunately, this remix breaks the rules in a lot of really blatant ways. While they provide a free download and aren't making any money off of the remix, they are taking away from the value of Bob Marley's original song. Granted, Bob Marley was a big enough musician to survive the monetary impact from a remix being created on a Soundcloud account, but there may be some people who choose this version over his original. 
	
  The nature of the copyrighted work, being in the form of a song, means that it is ["less likely to support a claim of fair use then factual work."](http://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html) That means that since this song isn't a news article that aggregates information together or simply conveys truth that is known to the public,  these artists will have a tough time making the argument for their use of someone else's original material being "**fair**." Of the original song, the remixers used a large amount of material from Marley's version, meaning that the portion used was substantial to the copyrighted work as a whole. Like we saw in the Remix Manifesto film, even taking small parts of songs can be considered violations of Fair Use and copyright law. With this in mind, despite the few lyrics heard in the song, they actually use most of the copyrighted material in the song. Bob Marley's version can be found below:

>"I want to love you
>and treat you right. 
>I want to love you,
>everyday and every night.

> We'll be together,
> with a roof right over our heads 
> we'll share the shelter
> of my single bed.

>We'll share the same room,
>for Jah provide the bread.
>Is this love, is this love, is this love, is this love that I'm feeling?
Is this love, is this love, is this love, is this love that I'm feeling?

>I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know now
>I gotta know, got to know, got to know now
>I, I'm willing and able
>So I throw my cards on your table


These lyrics repeat throughout the entire song, so the artists' use of these lyrics demonstrates a substantial amount of material from the original creative work. Even though there are only a few lyrics in the remix, they constitute a large portion of the lyrics in the original, making it a violation of the "substantiality" criterion in the fair use restrictions. 

####Lyric to Lyric Comparison


Bob Marley Version  |  Vicetone version
-------------------- | -------------------- 
I want to love you, and treat you right, | I want to love you, and treat you right,
I want to love you, every day and every night, | I want to love you, every day and every night,
We'll be together, with a roof right over our heads, | We'll be together, with a roof right over our heads,
We'll share the shelter, of my single bed,  | We'll share the shelter, of my single bed,
We'll share the same room, yeah! For Jah provide the bread.  | I want to know, want to know, want to know now
Is this love, is this love, is this love,  | I want to know, want to know, want to know now
Is this love that I'm feelin'?  | I want to know, want to know, want to know now
Is this love, is this love, is this love,  |I want to know, want to know, want to know know know
Is this love that I'm feelin'?  | (repeat)
I want to know, want to know, want to know now!  |
I got to know, got to know, got to know now! |
I, I'm willing and able,  |
So I throw my cards on your table!  |
I want to love you, I want to love and treat, love and treat you right,  |
I want to love you every day and every night,  |
We'll be together, yeah! With a roof right over our heads,  |
We'll shareâ€¦  |

_________________________


With the examination of Fair Use criteria, and the break down of the song lyrics demonstrating substantial similarities between the two, we can see once and for all that these artists did not play by the rules of the Fair Use game. The rules, designed to encourage people to create under protection from thievery, were very much broken when these artists took more material than they should've from Marley's original work.
